# RegularExpressionsCalculator

A set of webpages providing a regular expressions calculator, covering the regular expressions engine and a little of the history of formal grammars and finite automata. The project is still in development, and currently pre-alpha.

The Regular Expressions Calculator is designed to be a teaching/educational aid for CS students or interested learners. Later drafts will include animation and a simple drag and drop interface designed to allow students to build their own finite automata and run statements through it, in addition to the calculator and information on history and theory.

When this project reaches beta stage, it will be published and maintained for as long as possible. As a unique offering, it should provide learners with a much needed interactive tool for learning a complex subject.

Feedback and advice are always appreciated.
