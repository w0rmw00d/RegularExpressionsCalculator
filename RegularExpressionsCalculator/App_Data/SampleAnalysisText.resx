    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

  <data name="AtTheFishhouses" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Although it is a cold evening, 
down by one of the fishhouses 
an old man sits netting, 
his net, in the gloaming almost invisible, 
a dark purple-brown, 
and his shuttle worn and polished. 
The air smells so strong of codfish 
it makes one’s nose run and one’s eyes water. 
The five fishhouses have steeply peaked roofs 
and narrow, cleated gangplanks slant up 
to storerooms in the gables 
for the wheelbarrows to be pushed up and down on. 
All is silver: the heavy surface of the sea, 
swelling slowly as if considering spilling over, 
is opaque, but the silver of the benches, 
the lobster pots, and masts, scattered 
among the wild jagged rocks, 
is of an apparent translucence 
like the small old buildings with an emerald moss 
growing on their shoreward walls. 
The big fish tubs are completely lined 
with layers of beautiful herring scales 
and the wheelbarrows are similarly plastered 
with creamy iridescent coats of mail, 
with small iridescent flies crawling on them. 
Up on the little slope behind the houses, 
set in the sparse bright sprinkle of grass, 
is an ancient wooden capstan, 
cracked, with two long bleached handles 
and some melancholy stains, like dried blood, 
where the ironwork has rusted. 
The old man accepts a Lucky Strike. 
He was a friend of my grandfather. 
We talk of the decline in the population 
and of codfish and herring 
while he waits for a herring boat to come in. 
There are sequins on his vest and on his thumb. 
He has scraped the scales, the principal beauty, 
from unnumbered fish with that black old knife, 
the blade of which is almost worn away.
Down at the water’s edge, at the place 
where they haul up the boats, up the long ramp 
descending into the water, thin silver 
tree trunks are laid horizontally 
across the gray stones, down and down 
at intervals of four or five feet. 

Cold dark deep and absolutely clear, 
element bearable to no mortal, 
to fish and to seals . . . One seal particularly 
I have seen here evening after evening. 
He was curious about me. He was interested in music; 
like me a believer in total immersion, 
so I used to sing him Baptist hymns. 
I also sang “A Mighty Fortress Is Our God.” 
He stood up in the water and regarded me 
steadily, moving his head a little. 
Then he would disappear, then suddenly emerge 
almost in the same spot, with a sort of shrug 
as if it were against his better judgment. 
Cold dark deep and absolutely clear, 
the clear gray icy water . . . Back, behind us, 
the dignified tall firs begin. 
Bluish, associating with their shadows, 
a million Christmas trees stand 
waiting for Christmas. The water seems suspended 
above the rounded gray and blue-gray stones. 
I have seen it over and over, the same sea, the same, 
slightly, indifferently swinging above the stones, 
icily free above the stones, 
above the stones and then the world. 
If you should dip your hand in, 
your wrist would ache immediately, 
your bones would begin to ache and your hand would burn 
as if the water were a transmutation of fire 
that feeds on stones and burns with a dark gray flame. 
If you tasted it, it would first taste bitter, 
then briny, then surely burn your tongue. 
It is like what we imagine knowledge to be: 
dark, salt, clear, moving, utterly free, 
drawn from the cold hard mouth 
of the world, derived from the rocky breasts 
forever, flowing and drawn, and since 
our knowledge is historical, flowing, and flown.</value>

    <value>"You are old, Father William," the young man said,
"And your hair has become very white;
And yet you incessantly stand on your head—
Do you think, at your age, it is right?"

"In my youth," Father William replied to his son,
"I feared it might injure the brain;
But now that I'm perfectly sure I have none,
Why, I do it again and again."

"You are old," said the youth, "As I mentioned before,
And have grown most uncommonly fat;
Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door—
Pray, what is the reason of that?"

"In my youth," said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,
"I kept all my limbs very supple
By the use of this ointment—one shilling a box—
Allow me to sell you a couple?"

"You are old," said the youth, "And your jaws are too weak
For anything tougher than suet;
Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak—
Pray, how did you manage to do it?"

"In my youth," said his father, "I took to the law,
And argued each case with my wife;
And the muscular strength which it gave to my jaw,
Has lasted the rest of my life."

"You are old," said the youth, "one would hardly suppose
That your eye was as steady as ever;
Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose—
What made you so awfully clever?"

"I have answered three questions, and that is enough,"
Said his father; "don't give yourself airs!
Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?
Be off, or I'll kick you down stairs!"</value>

    <value>Now we're here again, the fat suicide
searching the garbage for a blade of hope,
the worn stairs sighing in the dark,
the bandages unwinding, the black holes
the needles made, the puffed tattoo,
the great belly arguing in its bed.

We come again and again on our bad feet
or running as the water runs all night
in the old pipes of the Hotel Florida.
She dozes on the bowl, our mother
of Malaga, and sings a little song of home
and washes the city slowly from her thighs.

All that was desire, all that was sleep,
all you dreamed before it could be true,
this hand flowering before your eyes, this hand
that read the epics the onion wrote
and talked to horses in the cold fields
when you were still the child you will become.</value>

“Beware the Jabberwock, my son! 
      The jaws that bite, the claws that catch! 
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun

He took his vorpal sword in hand; 
      Long time the manxome foe he sought— 
So rested he by the Tumtum tree 
      And stood awhile in thought. 

And, as in uffish thought he stood, 
      The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame, 
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood, 
      And burbled as it came! 

One, two! One, two! And through and through 
      The vorpal blade went snicker-snack! 
He left it dead, and with its head 
      He went galumphing back. 

“And hast thou slain the Jabberwock? 
      Come to my arms, my beamish boy! 
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!” 
      He chortled in his joy.

    <value>The art of losing isn’t hard to master; 
so many things seem filled with the intent 
to be lost that their loss is no disaster. 

Lose something every day. Accept the fluster 
of lost door keys, the hour badly spent. 
The art of losing isn’t hard to master. 

Then practice losing farther, losing faster: 
places, and names, and where it was you meant 
to travel. None of these will bring disaster. 

I lost my mother’s watch. And look! my last, or 
next-to-last, of three loved houses went. 
The art of losing isn’t hard to master. 

I lost two cities, lovely ones. And, vaster, 
some realms I owned, two rivers, a continent. 
I miss them, but it wasn’t a disaster. 

—Even losing you (the joking voice, a gesture 
I love) I shan’t have lied. It’s evident 
the art of losing’s not too hard to master 
though it may look like (Write it!) like disaster.</value>

Of industrial barns, out of rain, out of bus ride,

  <data name="WalrusCarpenter" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The sun was shining on the sea,
Shining with all his might:
He did his very best to make
The billows smooth and bright--
And this was odd, because it was
The middle of the night.

The moon was shining sulkily,
Because she thought the sun
Had got no business to be there
After the day was done--
"It's very rude of him," she said,
"To come and spoil the fun!"


The sea was wet as wet could be,
The sands were dry as dry.
You could not see a cloud, because
No cloud was in the sky:
No birds were flying overhead--
There were no birds to fly.

The Walrus and the Carpenter
Were walking close at hand;
They wept like anything to see
Such quantities of sand:
"If this were only cleared away,"
They said, "it would be grand!"

"If seven maids with seven mops
Swept it for half a year.
Do you suppose," the Walrus said,
"That they could get it clear?"
"I doubt it," said the Carpenter,
And shed a bitter tear.

"O Oysters, come and walk with us!"
The Walrus did beseech.
"A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,
Along the briny beach:
We cannot do with more than four,
To give a hand to each."

The eldest Oyster looked at him,
But never a word he said:
The eldest Oyster winked his eye,
And shook his heavy head--
Meaning to say he did not choose
To leave the oyster-bed.

But four young Oysters hurried up,
All eager for the treat:
Their coats were brushed, their faces washed,
Their shoes were clean and neat--
And this was odd, because, you know,
They hadn't any feet.

Four other Oysters followed them,
And yet another four;
And thick and fast they came at last,
And more, and more, and more--
All hopping through the frothy waves,
And scrambling to the shore.


The Walrus and the Carpenter
Walked on a mile or so,
And then they rested on a rock
Conveniently low:
And all the little Oysters stood
And waited in a row.

"The time has come," the Walrus said,
"To talk of many things:
Of shoes--and ships--and sealing-wax--
Of cabbages--and kings--
And why the sea is boiling hot--
And whether pigs have wings."

"But wait a bit," the Oysters cried,
"Before we have our chat;
For some of us are out of breath,
And all of us are fat!"
"No hurry!" said the Carpenter.
They thanked him much for that.

"A loaf of bread," the Walrus said,
"Is what we chiefly need:
Pepper and vinegar besides
Are very good indeed--
Now if you're ready, Oysters dear,
We can begin to feed."

"But not on us!" the Oysters cried,
Turning a little blue.
"After such kindness, that would be
A dismal thing to do!"
"The night is fine," the Walrus said.
"Do you admire the view?


"It was so kind of you to come!
And you are very nice!"
The Carpenter said nothing but
"Cut us another slice:
I wish you were not quite so deaf--
I've had to ask you twice!"

"It seems a shame," the Walrus said,
"To play them such a trick,
After we've brought them out so far,
And made them trot so quick!"
The Carpenter said nothing but
"The butter's spread too thick!"

"I weep for you," the Walrus said:
"I deeply sympathize."
With sobs and tears he sorted out
Those of the largest size,
Holding his pocket-handkerchief
Before his streaming eyes.

"O Oysters," said the Carpenter,
"You've had a pleasant run!
Shall we be trotting home again?'
But answer came there none--
And this was scarcely odd, because
They'd eaten every one.</value>

  <data name="YouCanHaveIt" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>My brother comes home from work 
and climbs the stairs to our room. 
I can hear the bed groan and his shoes drop   
one by one. You can have it, he says. 

The moonlight streams in the window   
and his unshaven face is whitened 
like the face of the moon. He will sleep 
long after noon and waken to find me gone. 

Thirty years will pass before I remember   
that moment when suddenly I knew each man   
has one brother who dies when he sleeps   
and sleeps when he rises to face this life, 

and that together they are only one man   
sharing a heart that always labors, hands   
yellowed and cracked, a mouth that gasps   
for breath and asks, Am I gonna make it? 

All night at the ice plant he had fed 
the chute its silvery blocks, and then I   
stacked cases of orange soda for the children   
of Kentucky, one gray boxcar at a time 

with always two more waiting. We were twenty   
for such a short time and always in 
the wrong clothes, crusted with dirt 
and sweat. I think now we were never twenty. 

In 1948 in the city of Detroit, founded 
by de la Mothe Cadillac for the distant purposes   
of Henry Ford, no one wakened or died,   
no one walked the streets or stoked a furnace, 

for there was no such year, and now 
that year has fallen off all the old newspapers, 
calendars, doctors’ appointments, bonds,   
wedding certificates, drivers licenses. 

The city slept. The snow turned to ice.   
The ice to standing pools or rivers 
racing in the gutters. Then bright grass rose   
between the thousands of cracked squares, 

and that grass died. I give you back 1948.   
I give you all the years from then 
to the coming one. Give me back the moon   
with its frail light falling across a face. 

Give me back my young brother, hard 
and furious, with wide shoulders and a curse   
for God and burning eyes that look upon   
all creation and say, You can have it.</value>
